Python code to scrape data or access the APIs from store finders for some UK store chains:

* 🛒 [ALDI](https://www.aldi.co.uk/)
* 🥐 [GAIL's Bakery](https://gailsbread.co.uk/)
* 🍷 [Majestic Wine](https://www.majestic.co.uk/)
* 🛒 [Marks & Spencer](https://www.marksandspencer.com/)
* 🛒 [Sainsbury's](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/)
* 🛒 [Tesco](https://www.tesco.com/)
* 🛒 [Waitrose](https://www.waitrose.com/)

Started as a joke to visualise the "posh areas of London" according to [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/wuwc6c/indicators_of_posh_area_in_london/).

All scrapers output GeoJSON with just the points for now. Other metadata (e.g. store name/address/link to store page) will be added in the future.

Feel free to suggest other chains to scrape by raising an issue, or to make improvements by PR.
