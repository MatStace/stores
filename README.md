Python code to scrape data or access the APIs from store finders for some UK store chains.

Started as a joke to visualise the "posh areas of London" according to [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/wuwc6c/indicators_of_posh_area_in_london/).

All scrapers output GeoJSON with just the points for now. Other metadata (e.g. store name/address/link to store page) will be added in the future.

Feel free to suggest other chains to scrape by raising an issue, or to make improvements by PR.
